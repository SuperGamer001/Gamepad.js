# Gamepad.js
This script allows controller compatibility to Web apps or Electron apps. Many different controllers have different button mappings, which can cause issues. This script makes it easier to "pair up" your controller to your Javascript games.

If your controller isn't on this list, please feal free to add it to the buttonMapping list into the file.
