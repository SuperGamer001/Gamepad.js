# Gamepad.js
This script allows controller compatibility to Web apps or Electron apps. Many different controllers have different button mappings, which can cause issues. This script makes it easier to "pair up" your controller to your Javascript games.

If your controller isn't on this list, please feel free to add it to the buttonMapping list into the file.
Soon, I'm going to add a test folder with two files. One will be for testing if the controller API works with your controller, and Two will tell you what your device is thinking is being pressed so you know how the mapping of your controller is set up.
