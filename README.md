# Gamepad.js
This script allows controller compatibility to Web apps or Electron apps. Many different controllers have different button mappings, which can cause issues. This script makes it easier to "pair up" your controller to your Javascript games.

It isn't much now, so please add other controller mappings to this script whenever you can.
